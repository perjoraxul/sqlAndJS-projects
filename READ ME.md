- built an Instagram clone database using goormIDE;

- used structured queries for answering trivial question about clients, like :
	1) I want to reward my users who have been around the longest. Who are the 5 oldest users?
	2) I am trying to schedule an add cam pain where I try to get new people to sign-up. Due to budget limitations, I must figure out what day of the week it's going to work the best, for running my add. So, what day of the week do most new users register on? 
	3) I want to target my inactive users with an email campaign, so I must find the users who have never posted a photo.
	4) What user has the most liked photo? (If we want to run a contest)
	5) How many times does the average user post a photo?
	6) What are the top 5 most commonly used hastags?
	7) Find users who have liked every single photo on the site.

- built Join Us website with Express.js and + connected SQL database.
